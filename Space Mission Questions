-- For each of these projects I wanted them to be something that personally interests me and as I am a very big fan of space I knew the moment I saw the ## Space Mission Analysis  [All Space Missions from 1957](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957) that it would the perfect choice to do an analysis on
-- However I did notice that there was a similar analysis done with this dataset that was posted publicly on 	[Medium](https://medium.com/) so did want to keep this analysis brief and simple so as not to make my work comparable to theirs

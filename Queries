**I would like to note that I did do a bit of data cleaning to the original spreadsheet before transferring to BigQuery/ There were two columns one being untitled and the other being "unamed" and as they were not important to the analysis I removed them** 
--Also note that this data only goees up to 2020 and no further--

--So to start I wanted to preview the data with a query to make sure it all came through 
SELECT *

FROM `sql-1-345800.space_mission.space_corrected`

-- Now that we can see that the preview show the correct info I first wanted to see who are the companies/ manufacturers involved
SELECT Company_Name

FROM `sql-1-345800.space_mission.space_corrected`

-- Even though this query is correct it returned every name each time it was mentioned so to solve this a DISTINCT was added and that returned our 56 companies 

-- Next up I was curious about which company had the most trips since 1957 but since there was no real value on the amount trips taken so I was not able to create a query for this however I could also gather this information with a pivot table in excel

--Looking at the data again I was curious about how many distinct locations the launches have taken place

SELECT DISTINCT Location

FROM `sql-1-345800.space_mission.space_corrected`

-- Now knowing this info I wanted to answer my biggest question "how many trips were successful/failures/partial failures?

SELECT  Status_Mission

FROM `sql-1-345800.space_mission.space_corrected`

WHERE Status_Mission = "Failure"

and

SELECT  Status_Mission

FROM `sql-1-345800.space_mission.space_corrected`

WHERE Status_Mission = "Partial Failure"

and

SELECT  Status_Mission

FROM `sql-1-345800.space_mission.space_corrected`

WHERE Status_Mission = "Success"

-- And finally for this short analysis I wondered how many of these projects still ongoing vs retired

SELECT  Status_Rocket

FROM `sql-1-345800.space_mission.space_corrected`

WHERE Status_Rocket = "StatusActive"

SELECT  Status_Rocket

FROM `sql-1-345800.space_mission.space_corrected`

WHERE Status_Rocket = "StatusRetired"

--That's the end of the queries that I've done for analysis. In the future I will add on to this with further questions to answer or a deep dive on some of the already existing information

--Before I got into the analysis of the data I started by coming up with a list of questions that'll help me get insights on my data
--Second I started by collecting my data about hotel bookings. This step was easy as I was able to find a pre made data set on 	[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand) however this dataset is from 2015 to 2017 so the insights are not accurate for 2022
--Next I started cleaning the data to do this I dropped my dataset into Excel and got to work. Now once again since this data set was premade there weren't many changes I wanted to make but I did drop a few columns that were a bit redundant(stays_in_weekend_nights, arrival_date_week_number, stays_in_week_nights) I also removed columms that were specifically made anonymous which lead to nulls in the analysis(reserved_room_type, assigned_room_type, agent, company, ) now I know that may seem like a lot of removals but we are now working 21 columns with 119,391 rows of data
-- With all of that out of the way I now download the clean dataset and take into BigQuery to start analyzing wuth SQL

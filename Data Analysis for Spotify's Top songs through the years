--Before I got into the analysis of the data I started by coming up with a list of questions that'll help me get insights on my data
--Second I started by collecting my data about spotify's top songs through the yearss. This step was easy as I was able to find a pre made data set on 	[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019) 
--Next I started cleaning the data to do this I dropped my dataset into Excel and got to work. Since this was a premade dataset I didn't want to change much but I did alter some of the columns formats to make them more understandable during the analysis such as changing the duration column which is measured in ms to seconds
-- With all of that out of the way I now download the clean dataset and take into BigQuery to start analyzing wuth SQL
--To start I get a preview of the data to make sure it looks correct

SELECT *
 FROM `sql-1-345800.spotify.top_songs` 
--

SELECT DISTINCT  year, song, artist
 FROM `sql-1-345800.spotify.top_songs`
WHERE year = 2019

--This is just a test query I ran aas I noticed there may not be the same amount of songs listed in each year. I actually ran this for all the years but since it was a test I'm leaving that query out

--Next I started by looking for the most popular genre 

SELECT genre
 FROM `sql-1-345800.spotify.top_songs`
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC

--Then I wanted to see the difference between 2000 and 2019s top genre

SELECT DISTINCT genre, year
 FROM `sql-1-345800.spotify.top_songs`
 WHERE year = 2000
GROUP BY genre,year 

SELECT DISTINCT genre, year
 FROM `sql-1-345800.spotify.top_songs`
 WHERE year = 2019 
 GROUP BY genre,year

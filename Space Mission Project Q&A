-- For each of these projects I wanted them to be something that personally interests me and as I am a very big fan of space I knew the moment I saw the ## Space Mission Analysis  [All Space Missions from 1957](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957) that it would the perfect choice to do an analysis on
-- However I did notice that there was a similar analysis done with this dataset that was posted publicly on 	[Medium](https://medium.com/) so did want to keep this analysis brief and simple so as not to make my work comparable to theirs

-- When Looking at the spreadsheet for the space missions the main questions I wanted answered were 

1. How many of these projects still ongoing vs retired?
2. How many trips were successful/failures/partial failures?
3. How many distinct locations the launches have taken place?
4. Who are the companies/ manufacturers involved

-- And using SQL I learned 

1. There are only 739 Active and there are 3,534 Retired
2. There were 339 Failures, 3,879 Successes and 102 Partial Failures
3. The amount of launches that have taken place since 1957 have only occurred at 137 distinct locations this is interesting because there have been 4,317 trips/launches 
4. There are only 56 companies that have contributed to the space missions
